# 3D Javascript Maze

3D Labyrinth written in Javascript. Maze generator was written [earlier](https://github.com/okkindel/MazeGenerator) in Java. You controll camera by arrows, Shift for moving horizontaly. It uses canvas to draw minimap and raycasting system. Level creator was also done earlier, during [this](https://github.com/okkindel/TankGame) project.

Technique was used in Wolfenstain 3D. Some effects was added by me.
